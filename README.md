## Hi there 👋
🔭 I’m currently working on Python-based GUI applications, small full-stack projects, and beginner-friendly open-source contributions.

🌱 I’m currently learning Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning fundamentals, and modern web technologies.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, educational tech tools, and beginner-to-intermediate software projects.

🤔 I’m looking for help with system design basics, optimizing code performance, and real-world project architecture.

💬 Ask me about Python, C/C++, basic ML concepts, GUI development, and getting started in computer science.

📫 How to reach me: GitHub issues, discussions, or linked social profiles.
